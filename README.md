# sentiment-of-the-union
A project I began in December 2018 where I used NLP tools in Python (NLTK, WordCloud, gensim, etc.) to perform sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and some other forms of analysis on Presidential State of the Union addresses.
My article in Towards Data Science detailing insights from this project can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-of-the-union-analyzing-presidential-state-of-the-union-addresses-with-python-2a8667a578b9)
