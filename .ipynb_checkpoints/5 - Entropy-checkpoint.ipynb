       "'to the congress of the united the state of the union is our economy is recovering from a a national energy plan is in place and our dependence on foreign oil is we have been at peace for four uninterrupted our nation has serious inflation and unemployment are unacceptably the world oil market is increasingly there are trouble spots throughout the and american hostages are being held in iran against international law and against every precept of human i firmly believe as a result of the progress made in so many domestic and international areas over the past four our nation is more compassionate and freer than it was four years i am proud of that and i believe the congress should be proud as for so much of what has been accomplished over the past four years has been due to the hard insights and cooperation of i applaud the congress for its efforts and its in this state of the union message i want to recount the achievements and progress of the last four years and to offer recommendations to the congress for this while my term as president will end before the congress begins its work in i hope that my recommendations will serve as a guide for the direction this country should take so we build on the record of the past four record of progress when i took our nation faced a number of serious domestic and international national energy policy and our dependence on foreign oil was rapidly trust in the integrity and openness of the government was federal government was operating inefficiently in administering essential programs and social problems were being ignored or poorly addressed by the federal defense posture was declining as a result of a defense budget which was continuously shrinking in real strength of the nato alliance needed to be between israel and egypt threatened another middle east and resolve to oppose human rights violations was under serious over the past clear progress has been made in solving the challenges we found in january of all of our comprehensive energy program have been and the department of energy has been established to administer the confidence in the integrity has been and respect for the openness and fairness has been government has been made more effective and the civil service system was completely reformed for the first time this reorganization initiatives have been proposed to the and new cabinet departments have been created to consolidate and streamline the handling of energy and education general have been placed in each cabinet department to combat waste and other regulatory process has been reformed through creation of the regulatory implementation of executive order and its requirement for elimination of unnecessary and passage of the regulatory flexibility have been established to assure citizen participation in the rail and communications industries are being social many long ignored by the federal have been addressed urban policy was developed and implemented to reverse the decline in our urban social security system was refinanced to put it on a sound financial full employment act was assistance for education was expanded by more than minimum wage was increased to levels needed to ease the effects of action has been pursued more hispanics and women have been appointed to senior government positions and to judgeships than at any other time in our era ratification deadline was extended to aid the ratification minority business procurement by the federal government has more than first sectoral policies were put in for the auto and steel with my administration demonstrating the value of cooperation between the business and previous real defense spending has increased every year since real increase in fy defense spending is well above percent and i expect fy defense spending to be even the defense program i am proposing is premised on a real increase in defense spending over the next five years of percent or nato alliance has proven its unity in responding to the situations in eastern europe and southwest asia and in agreeing on the issues to be addressed in the review of the helsinki final act currently underway in peace process in the middle east established at camp david and by the peace treaty between egypt and israel is being buttressed on two steady progress in the normalization of relations in many and the commitment of both egypt and with united to see through to successful conclusion the autonomy negotiations for the west bank and panama canal treaties have been put into which has helped to improve relations with latin have continued this strong commitment to the pursuit of human rights throughout the evenhandedly and commitment to a worldwide human rights policy has remained many other countries have given high priority to resolve to oppose such as the illegal invasion of the soviet union into has been supported by tough ensuring economic strength economy during the last decade our nation has withstood a series of economic shocks unprecedented in the most dramatic of these has been the explosive increases of opec oil but we have also faced world commodity natural agricultural shortages and major challenges to world peace and our ability to deal with these shocks has been impaired because of a decrease in the growth of productivity and the persistence of underlying inflationary forces built up over the past the economy has proved to be remarkably real output has grown at an average rate of percent per year since i took and employment has grown by we have added about million productive private sector jobs to the unacceptably high most difficult economic problem i have this threatens the and stability of our that we restrain the growth of the budget to the maximum extent consistent with national security and human i have done so in my earlier and in my fy while restraint is essential to any appropriate economic high inflation cannot be attributed solely to government the growth in budget outlays has been more the result of economic factors than the cause of we are now in the early stages of economic recovery following a short a period has been marked by vigorous economic growth aided by policy measures such as large tax cuts or stimulation spending i have declined to recommend such actions to stimulate economic because the persistent inflationary pressures that beset our economy today dictate a restrained fiscal i am asking the congress to postpone until january the personal tax reductions i had earlier proposed to take effect on january of this my budget proposes significant tax changes to increase the sources of financing for business while emphasizing the need for continued fiscal this budget takes the first major step in a tax reduction program designed to increase capital the failure of our capital stock to grow at a rate that keeps pace with its labor force has clearly been one cause of our productivity higher investment rates are also critically needed to meet our energy and to replace plants and equipment with new physical the level of investment that is called for will not occur in the absence of policies to encourage my budget proposes a major liberalization of tax allowances for as well as simplified depreciation increasing the allowable rates by about i am also proposing improvements in the investment tax making it to meet the investment needs of firms with no current these two along with tax reductions for will improve both economic efficiency and tax i urge the congress to enact legislation along the lines and timetable i have the budget the fy budget i have sent to the congress continues our policy of prudence and while the budget deficits during my term are higher than i would have their size is determined for the most part by economic and in spite of these the relative size of the deficit continues to in before i took the budget deficit equalled percent of gross national it had been cut to percent in the fiscal year just my budget contains a deficit estimated to be less than percent of our gross national the rate of growth in federal spending has been held to a outlays are still rising more rapidly than many had the result of many powerful forces in our we face a threat to our as events in the middle and eastern europe make we have a steadily aging population as a the biggest single increase in the federal budget is the rising cost of retirement particularly social we face other important domestic to continue responsibility for the to provide the capital needed by our cities and our transportation to protect our to revitalize american and to increase the export of american goods and services so essential to the creation of jobs and a trade yet the federal government itself may not always be the proper source of such for it must not usurp functions if they can be more appropriately decided and financed by the private sector or by state and local my administration has always sought to consider the proper focus of responsibility for the most efficient resolution of we have also recognized the need to simplify the system of grants to state and local i have again proposed several grant consolidations in the including a new proposal that would consolidate several highway the pressures for growth in federal use of national resources are my administration has initiated many new approaches to cope with these we started a budget and we began a system for controlling federal credit yet in spite of increasing needs to limit spending we have consistently adhered to these strong budget our armed forces must always stand sufficiently strong to deter aggression and to assure our an effective national energy plan is essential to increase domestic production of oil and to encourage conservation of our scarce energy to stimulate conversion to more abundant and to reduce our trade the essential human needs for our citizens must be given the highest the federal government must lead the way in investment in the technological the federal government has an obligation to nurture and protect our common and sustenance of the american my budget continues to support these it also proposes responsible tax reductions to encourage a more productive and adequate funding of our highest priority programs within an overall policy of fiscal restraint must be continued in the years budgets must be tight enough to convince those who set wages and prices that the federal government is serious about fighting inflation but not so tight as to choke off all careful budget policy should be supplemented by other measures designed to reduce inflation at lower cost in lost output and these other steps include measures to increase as the tax proposals included in my measures to increase competition and productivity in our voluntary incomes policies can also directly influence wages and prices in the direction of moderation and thereby bring inflation down faster and at lower cost to the through a incomes policy we could provide tax incentives for firms and workers to moderate their wage and price in the coming control of federal expenditures can make possible periodic tax the congress should therefore begin now to evaluate the potentialities of a tip program so that when the next round of tax reductions is appropriate a tip program will be seriously employment during the last four years we have given top priority to meeting the needs of workers and providing additional job opportunities to those who seek since the end of almost million new jobs have been added to the economy total employment has reached more jobs than ever before are held by minorities and young employment over the past four years has increased for adult women for and for hispanics employment of black teenagers increased by more than reversing the decline that occurred in the previous eight major initiatives launched by this administration helped bring about these accomplishments and have provided a solid foundation for employment and training policy in the in as part of the comprehensive economic stimulus public service jobs were created a billion youth employment initiative funded jobs the doubling of the job corps to slots began and million summer youth jobs were percent in the full employment act became law the million private sector initiatives program was begun a targeted jobs tax credit for disadvantaged youth and others with special employment barriers was enacted the comprehensive employment and training act was reauthorized for four in a billion welfare reform proposal was introduced with funding for public service jobs welfare reform demonstration projects were launched in communities around the country the vice president initiated a nationwide review of youth unemployment in this in the findings of the vice task force revealed the major education and employment deficits that exist for poor and minority as a result a billion youth education and jobs initiative was introduced to provide unemployed youth with the basic education and work experience they need to compete in the labor market of the as part of the economic revitalization program several steps were proposed to aid workers in high unemployment an additional weeks of unemployment benefits for the long term million to train the disadvantaged and unemployed for new private sector positive adjustment demonstrations to aid workers in declining the important title vii private sector initiatives program was reauthorized for an additional two in addition to making significant progress in helping the disadvantaged and important gains were realized for all an historic national accord with organized labor made it possible for the views of working men and women to be heard as the economic and domestic policies were the mine safety and health act brought about improved working conditions for the substantial reforms of occupational safety and health administration were accomplished to help reduce unnecessary burdens on business and to focus on major health and safety the minimum wage was increased over a four year period from to an the black lung benefit reform act was signed into attempts to weaken act were while substantial gains have been made in the last four continued efforts are required to ensure that this progress is government must continue to make labor a full partner in the policy decisions that affect the interests of working men and a bipartisan effort to combat youth unemployment must be sustained compassionate reform of the welfare system should be continued with employment opportunities provided for those able to workers in declining industries should be provided new skills and help in finding trade over the past the trade picture improved as a result of solid export gains in both manufactured and agricultural agricultural exports reached a new record of over while manufactured exports have grown by percent to a record in these areas the united states recorded significant surpluses of billion and billion while our oil imports remained a major drain on our foreign exchange that drain was somewhat moderated by a percent decline in the volume of oil trade negotiators made significant progress over the past year in assuring effective implementation of the agreements negotiated during the tokyo round of multilateral trade agreements reached with the japanese for will assure that the united states will be able to expand its exports to the japanese market in such key areas as telecommunications and efforts by trade negotiators also helped to persuade a number of key developing countries to accept many of the codes negotiated during the multilateral trade this will assure that these countries will increasingly assume obligations under the international trading a difficult world economic environment posed a challenge for the management of trade trade negotiators were called upon to manage serious sectoral problems in such areas as and helped to assure that chemical exports will have continued access to the european close consultations with the private sector in the united states have enabled trade negotiators to pinpoint obstacles to trade in and to build a basis for future services have been an increasingly important source of export earnings for the united and the united states must assure continued and increased access to foreign the trade position of the united states has but vigorous efforts are needed in a number of areas to assure continued market access for particularly agricultural and high technology in which the united states continues to have a strong competitive continued efforts are also needed to remove many domestic which now hamper export and we must ensure that countries do not manipulate or impose investment performance requirements which distort trade and cost us jobs in this in we must continue to seek that is the policy my administration has pursued from the even in areas where foreign competition has clearly affected our domestic in the steel for we have put trigger price mechanism into place to help prevent the dumping of that action has strengthened the domestic steel in the automobile we have without resort to import strengthen the ability to modernize and compete small business i have often said that there is nothing small about small business in these firms account for nearly our gross national over half of new and much more than half of the jobs created by because this sector of the economy is the very lifeblood of our national we have done much together to improve the competitive climate for smaller these concerted efforts have been an integral part of my program to revitalize the they include my campaign to shrink substantially the cash and time consuming red tape burden imposed on they include my policy of ambitiously increasing the federal contracting dollars going to small especially those owned by women and and they include my proposals to reinvigorate existing small businesses and assist the creation of new ones through tax financing market and support of product many of my initiatives to facilitate the creation and growth of small businesses were made in response to the white house conference on small which i my administration began the implementation of most of the ideas produced last year by that advisory others need to be i have proposed the reconvening of the conference next year to review reassess and set new in the interim i hope that the incoming administration and the new congress will work with the committee i have established to keep these business development ideas alive and help implement conference minority business one of the most successful developments of my administration has been the growth and strengthening of minority this is the first administration to put the issue on the policy agenda as a matter of major to implement the results of our early efforts in this field i submitted legislation to congress designed to further the development of minority we have reorganized the office of minority business into the minority business development administration in the department of mbda has already proven to be a major factor in assisting minority businesses to achieve equitable competitive positions in the the federal procurement from firms has nearly tripled since i took federal deposits in banks have more than doubled and minority ownership of radio and television stations has nearly the sba administered pilot program for procurement with the army proved to be successful and i recently expanded the number of agencies involved to include nasa and the departments of energy and i firmly believe the critical path to full freedom and equality for minorities rests with the ability of minority communities to participate competitively in the free enterprise i believe the government has a fundamental responsibility to assist in the development of minority business and i hope the progress made in the last four years will creating energy security since i took my highest legislative priorities have involved the reorientation and redirection of energy activities and for the first to establish a coordinated national energy the struggle to achieve that policy has been long and but the accomplishments of the past four years make clear that our country is finally serious about the problems caused by our overdependence on foreign our progress should not be we must rely on and encourage multiple forms of energy crude natural energy the framework put in place over the last four years will enable us to do national energy policy as a result of actions my administration and the congress have taken over the past four our country finally has a national energy under my program of phased domestic crude oil price controls will end september as a result exploratory drilling activities have reached an prices for new natural gas are being decontrolled under the natural gas policy natural gas production is now at an all time the supply shortages of several years ago have been the windfall profits tax on crude oil has been enacted providing billion over ten years for assistance to increased mass transit and a massive investment in the production and development of alternative energy the synthetic fuels corporation has been established to help private companies build the facilities to produce energy from synthetic solar energy funding has been solar energy tax credits and a solar energy and energy conservation bank has been a route has been chosen to bring natural gas from the north slope of alaska to the lower coal production and consumption incentives have been and coal production is now at its highest level in a gasoline rationing plan has been approved by congress for possible use in the event of a severe energy supply shortage or gasohol production has been dramatically with a program being put in place to produce million gallons of alcohol fuel by the end of this amount that could enable gasohol to meet the demand for percent of all unleaded new energy conservation incentives have been provided for businesses and communities and conservation has increased the has reduced oil imports by million barrels per the past four increased development of domestic energy sources although it is essential that the nation reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels and complete the transition to reliance on domestic renewable sources of it is also important that this transition be accomplished in an and environmentally sound to this the administration has launched several leasing of oil and natural gas on federal particularly the outer continental has been accelerated at the same time as the administration has reformed leasing procedures through the amendments to the outer continental shelf lands in the interior department held six ocs lease the greatest number which resulted in federal receipts of another the ocs leasing schedule was requiring sales over the next five since no general federal coal lease sales were over the past four years the administration has completely revised the federal coal leasing program to bring it into compliance with the requirements of federal land planning and management act and other statutory the program is designed to balance the competing interests that affect resource development on public lands and to ensure that adequate supplies of coal will be available to meet national as a the first general competitive federal coal lease sale in ten years will be held this in july i signed into law the energy security act of which established the synthetic fuels the corporation is designed to spur the development of commercial technologies for production of synthetic such as liquid and gaseous fuels from coal and the production of oil from oil the act provides the corporation with an initial billion to accomplish these the principal purpose of the legislation is to ensure that the nation will have available in the late the option to undertake commercial development of synthetic fuels if that becomes the energy security act also provides significant incentives for the development of gasohol and biomass thereby enhancing the supply of alternative energy commitment to a sustainable energy future the national energy plan marked an historic departure from the policies of previous the plan stressed the importance of both energy production and conservation to achieving our ultimate national goal of relying primarily on secure sources of the national energy plan made energy conservation a cornerstone of our national energy in i initiated the solar domestic policy this represented the first step towards widespread introduction of renewable energy sources into the as a result of the i issued the solar message to the first such message in the the message outlined the solar program and established an ambitious national goal for the year of obtaining percent of this energy from solar and renewable the thrust of the federal solar program is to help industry develop solar energy sources by emphasizing basic research and development of solar technologies which are not currently such as which generate energy directly from the at the same through tax and the solar energy and energy conservation the solar program seeks to encourage state and local and our citizens to expand their use of solar and renewable resource technologies currently as a result of these policies and the energy efficiency of the american economy has improved markedly and investments in renewable energy sources have grown it now takes percent less energy to produce a constant dollar of gnp than it did in january this increase in efficiency represents a savings of over million barrels per day of oil about the level of total oil production now occurring in over the same federal support for conservation and solar energy has increased by more than to billion in fy including the tax credits for solar energy and energy conservation credits are expected to amount to billion in fy and billion in fy commitment to nuclear safety and security since january significant progress has been achieved in resolving three critical problems resulting from the use of nuclear radioactive waste nuclear safety and weapons in the administration announced its nuclear nonproliferation policy and initiated the international fuel cycle in congress passed the nuclear nonproliferation an historic piece of in february the administration transmitted its nuclear waste management policy to the this policy was a major advance over all previous the principal aspects of that policy acknowledging the seriousness of the problem and the numerous technical and institutional adopting a technically and environmentally conservative approach to the first permanent and providing the states with significant involvement in nuclear waste disposal decisions by creating the state planning while much of the plan can be and is being implemented some new authorities are the congress should give early priority to enacting provisions for storage and the state planning the accident at three mile island made the nation acutely aware of the safety risks posed by nuclear power in the president established the kemeny commission to review the accident and make virtually all of the substantive recommendations were adopted by the administration and are now being implemented by the nuclear regulatory the congress adopted the proposed plan for the nuclear regulatory commission and the nuclear safety oversight committee was established to ensure that the decisions were nuclear safety will remain a vital concern in the years we must continue to press ahead for the secure disposal of radioactive and prevention of nuclear while significant growth in foreign demand for steam coal is congestion must be removed at major coal exporting ports such as hampton and my administration has worked through the interagency coal task force study to promote cooperation and coordination of resources between vessel operators and port and to determine the most appropriate federal role in expanding and modernizing coal export including dredging deeper channels at selected as a result of the task administrative steps have been taken by the corps of engineers to reduce significantly the amount of time required for planning and economic review of port dredging the administration has also recommended that the congress enact legislation to give the president generic authority to recommend appropriations for channel dredging private industry of play the major role in developing the united coal export but the government must continue to work to facilitate transportation to foreign enhancing basic human and social needs for too long prior to my many of our basic human and social needs were being ignored or handled insensitively by the federal over the last four we have significantly increased funding for many of the vital programs in these developed new programs where needs were targeted federal support to those individuals and areas most in need of our and removed barriers that have unnecessarily kept many disadvantaged citizens from obtaining aid for their most basic our record has produced clear progress in the effort to solve some of the fundamental human and social my administration and the working have demonstrated that government must and can meet our basic human and social needs in a responsible and compassionate but there is an unfinished agenda still before the if we are to meet our obligations to help all americans realize the dreams of sound health decent effective social a good and a meaningful important legislation still must be national health welfare child health assessment are before the congress and i urge their health national health plan during my i proposed to congress a national health plan which will enable the country to reach the goal of universal health care the legislation i submitted lays the foundation for this comprehensive plan and addresses the most serious problems of health financing and it is realistic and it does not overpromise or as a can be the solution to the thirty years of congressional battles on national health my plan includes the following key nearly million additional poor would receive comprehensive and delivery services are provided for all pregnant women and coverage is provided for all acute care for infants in their first year of the elderly and disabled would have a limit of placed on annual medical expenses and would no longer face limits on hospital all employees and their families would receive insurance against at least major medical expenses under mandated employer medicare and medicaid would be combined and expanded into an umbrella federal for increased program accountability and and strong cost controls and health system reforms would be including greater incentives for health maintenance i urge the new congress to compare my plan with the which either do too little to improve the health care needs of americans most in need or programs which would impose substantial financial burdens on the american i hope the congress will see the need for and the benefits of my plan and work toward prompt we cannot afford further delay in this vital health care cost control inflation in health care costs remains unacceptably throughout my legislation to reduce health care cost inflation was one of my highest but was not passed by the my fy budget proposes sharing the responsibility for health care cost control with the private through voluntary hospital cost guidelines and intensified in the longer the health care reimbursement system must be we must move away from inflationary reimbursement and and toward a system of prospective under which health care providers would operate within predetermined this reimbursement reform is essential to ultimately control inflation in health care and will be a significant challenge to the new health promotion and disease prevention during my the surgeon general released a landmark report on health promotion and disease the report signals the growing consensus that the health strategy must be refocused in the to emphasize the prevention of the report lays out measurable and achieveable goals in the reduction of mortality which can be reached by i urge the new congress to endorse the principles of and to adopt the recommendations to achieve its this will necessitate adoption of a broader concept of health to include such areas as environmental workplace health and commercial product traffic and health promotion and maternal and child health ensuring a healthy start in life for children remains not only a high priority of my but also one of the most cost effective forms of health when i took immunization levels for preventable childhood diseases had fallen to as a result of a concerted nationwide effort during my i am pleased to report that now at least of children under and virtually all children are in reported cases of measles and mumps are at their lowest levels under the national health plan i have there would be no for prenatal and delivery services for all pregnant women and for acute care provided to infants in their first year of these preventive services have extremely high returns in terms of improved newborn and child under the child health assurance program legislation which i submitted to the and which passed the an additional two million children under would become eligible for medicaid which would include special health chap would also improve the continuity of care for the nearly million children now eligible for an additional pregnant women would become eligible for prenatal care under the i strongly urge the new congress to enact chap and thereby provide millions of needy children with essential health the legislation has had strong bipartisan which should continue as the details of the bill are i also urge the new congress to provide strong support for two highly successful ongoing the special supplemental food program for infants and children and family the food supplements under wic have been shown to effectively prevent ill health and thereby reduce later medical the family planning program has been effective at reducing unwanted pregnancies among women and expansion of services to the poor and underserved during my health services to the poor and underserved have been dramatically the number of national health service corps assignees providing services in medically underserved communities has grown from in to nearly in the population served by the nhsc has more than tripled since the number of community health centers providing services in high priority underserved areas has doubled during my and will serve an estimated six million people in i strongly urge the new congress to support these highly successful mental health one of the most significant health achievements during my administration was the recent passage of the mental health systems which grew out of recommendations of my commission on mental i join many others in my gratitude to the first lady for her tireless and effective contribution to the passage of this important the act is designed to inaugurate a new era of federal and state partnership in the planning and provision of mental health in the act specifically provides for prevention and support services to the chronically mentally ill to prevent unnecessary institutionalization and for the development of mental health i urge the new congress to provide adequate support for the full and timely implementation of this health protection with my active the congress recently passed which provides for voluntary certification of health insurance policies supplemental to to curb widespread abuses in this in the area of toxic agent legislation which i submitted to the congress recently this will provide for a to cover hazardous waste cleanup in the area of accidental injury we have established automobile safety standards and increased enforcement activities with respect to the mph speed by the end of the decade these actions are expected to save over lives and serious injuries each i urge the new congress to continue strong support for all these food and nutrition building on the comprehensive reform of the food stamp program that i proposed and congress passed in my administration and the congress worked together in and to enact several other important changes in the these changes will further simplify administration and reduce fraud and will make the program more responsive to the needs of the elderly and and will increase the cap on allowable program the food stamp act will expire at the end of fiscal it is essential that the new administration and the congress continue this program to ensure complete eradication of the debilitating malnutrition witnessed and documented among thousands of children in the drug abuse prevention at the beginning of my administration there were over a half million heroin addicts in the united our continued emphasis on reducing the supply of as well as providing treatment and rehabilitation to its has reduced the heroin addict reduced the number of heroin overdose deaths by and reduced the number of heroin related injuries by we have also seen and encouraged a national movement of parents and citizens committed to reversing the very serious and disturbing trends of adolescent drug drug abuse in many forms will continue to from the quality of life of many to prevent i see four great challenges in the years we must deal aggressively with the supplies of illegal drugs at their through joint crop destruction programs with foreign nations and increased law enforcement and border we must look to citizens and parents across the country to help educate the increasing numbers of american youth who are experimenting with drugs to the dangers of drug education is a key factor in reducing drug we must focus our efforts on drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace for not only does this abuse contribute to low productivity but it also destroys the satisfaction and sense of purpose all americans can gain from the work we need a change in from an attitude which condones the casual use of drugs to one that recognizes the appropriate use of drugs for medical purposes and condemns the inappropriate and harmful abuse of i hope the congress and the new administration will take action to meet each of these education the american people have always recognized that education is one of the soundest investments they can the dividends are reflected in every dimension of our national the strength of our economy and national security to the vitality of our and among the accomplishments that have given me the most satisfaction over the last four years are the contributions that my administration has been able to make to the of students and educators throughout the this administration has collaborated successfully with the congress on landmark education working with the congressional my administration spotlighted the importance of education by creating a new department of the department has given education a stronger voice at the federal while at the same time reserving the actual control and operation of education to and private the department has successfully combined nearly federal education programs into a streamlined organization that is more responsive to the needs of educators and the department has made strides to cut red tape and paperwork and thereby to make the flow of federal dollars to school districts and institutions of higher education more it is crucial that the department be kept intact and our collaboration with the congress has resulted in numerous other important legislative accomplishments for a little over two years i signed into law on the same day two major benefiting elementary and secondary education and the postsecondary the education amendments of embodied nearly all of my proposals for improvements in the elementary and secondary education including important new programs to improve achievement in the basic skills and to aid school districts with exceptionally high concentrations of children from the middle income student assistance legislation jointly sponsored by this administration and the congressional expanded eligibility for basic educational opportunity grants to approximately of the students enrolled in education and made many more students eligible for the first time for other types of and just three and a half months my administration and the congress successfully concluded over two years of work on a major reauthorization bill that further expands benefits to postsecondary reflected in the education amendments of are major administration recommendations for improvements in the higher education proposals for better loan access for a new parent loan simplified application procedures for student financial a strengthened federal commitment to developing particularly the historically black a new authorization for equipment and facilities modernization funding for the major research and revitalized international education supplementing these legislative accomplishments have been important administrative actions aimed at reducing paperwork and simplifying regulations associated with federal education we also launched major initiatives to reduce the backlog of defaulted student loans and otherwise to curb and waste in education to insure that the education enterprise is ready to meet the scientific and technological changes of the we undertook a major study of the status of science and engineering education throughout the i hope that the findings from this report will serve as a springboard for needed reforms at all levels of i am proud that this administration has been able to provide the financial means to realize many of our legislative and administrative compared to the previous last i have requested the largest overall increase in federal funding for education in our my budget requests have been particularly sensitive to the needs of special populations like the educationally and economically the and students with limited at the same i have requested significant increases for many programs designed to enhance the quality of american including programs relating to important areas as diverse as international research and teacher last i proposed to the congress a major legislative initiative that would direct billion into education and job training programs designed to alleviate youth unemployment through improved linkages between the schools and the work this legislation generated bipartisan but action on it was not completed in the rushed days of the i urge the new it undertakes broad efforts to strengthen the economy as well as more specific tasks like reauthorizing the vocational education make the needs of our unemployed youth a top priority for only by combining a basic skills education program together with work training and employment incentives can we make substantial progress in eliminating one of the most severe social problems in our particularly among i am proud of the progress already made through passage of the youth employment and demonstration project act of and the substantial increase in our investment in youth employment the new legislation would cap these income security social security one of the highest priorities of my administration has been to continue the tradition of effectiveness and efficiency widely associated with the social security and to assure present and future beneficiaries that they will receive their benefits as the earned benefits that are paid monthly to retired and disabled american workers and their families provide a significant measure of economic protection to millions of people who might otherwise face retirement or possible disability with i have enacted changes to improve the benefits of many social security beneficiaries during my years as the last four years have presented a special set of concerns over the financial stability of the social security shortly after taking office i proposed and congress enacted legislation to protect the stability of the old age and survivors trust fund and prevent the imminent exhaustion of the disability insurance trust and to correct a flaw in the benefit formula that was threatening the long run health of the entire social security the actions taken by the congress at my request helped stabilize the that legislation was later complemented by the disability insurance amendments of which further bolstered the disability insurance and reduced certain inequities among my commitment to the essential retirement and disability protection provided to million people each month has been demonstrated by the fact that without interruption those beneficiaries have continued to receive their social security including annual cost of living changing and unpredictable economic circumstances require that we continue to monitor the financial stability of the social security to correct anticipated strains on the i proposed last year that the three funds be allowed to borrow from one and i urge the congress again this year to adopt such interfund to further strengthen the social security system and provide a greater degree of assurance to given projected future economic additional action should be among the additional financing options available are borrowing from the general financing half of the hospital insurance fund with general and increasing the payroll tax the latter option is particularly unpalatable given the significant increase in the tax rate already mandated in this administration continues to oppose cuts in basic social security benefits and taxing social security the administration continues to support annual indexing of social security welfare reform in i proposed a welfare reform package which offers solutions to some of the most urgent problems in our welfare this proposal is embodied in two the work and training opportunities act and the social welfare reform amendments the house passed the second of these two within the framework of our present welfare my reform proposals offer achievable means to increase through work rather than more adequate assistance to people unable to the removal of inequities in coverage under current and fiscal relief needed by states and our current welfare system is long overdue for serious the system is wasteful and not fully the legislation i have proposed will help eliminate inequities by establishing a national minimum and by directly relating benefit levels to the poverty it will reduce program which leads to inefficiency and by simplifying and coordinating administration among different i urge the congress to take action in this area along the lines i have child welfare my administration has worked closely with the congress on legislation which is designed to improve greatly the child welfare services and foster care programs and to create a federal system of adoption these improvements will be achieved with the recent enactment of the adoption assistance and child welfare act of the of children in need of homes and their permanent placement have been a primary concern of my this legislation will ensure that children are not lost in the foster care but instead will be returned to their families where possible or placed in permanent adoptive energy assistance in i proposed a program to provide an annual total of billion to households which are hardest hit by rising energy with the cooperation of we were able to move quickly to provide assistance to eligible households in time to meet their winter heating in response to the extreme heat conditions affecting many parts of the country during i directed the community services administration to make available over million to assist especially the facing life threatening circumstances due to extreme congress amended and reauthorized the energy assistance program for fiscal year and provided billion to meet anticipated increasing the need for a program to help households with rising energy expenses will not abate in the near the energy assistance program should be reauthorized to meet those housing for the past high interest rates have had a severe impact on the housing yet the current pressures and uncertainties should not obscure the achievements of the past four working with the the regulatory and the financial my administration has brought about an expanded and steadier flow of funds into home deregulation of the interest rates payable by depository the evolution of variable and renegotiated rate development of high yielding savings and expansion of the secondary mortgage market have all increased ability to attract capital and have assured that mortgage money would not be cut off when interest rates these actions will diminish the cyclicality of the housing we have secured legislation updating the federal emergency authority to provide support for the housing industry through the and creating a new section housing stimulus these tools will enable the federal government to deal quickly and effectively with serious distress in this critical we have also worked to expand homeownership opportunities for by using innovative financing such as the graduated payment we have increased the access of middle income families to housing by revitalizing the section we have enabled nearly moderate income households to purchase new by reducing paperwork and regulation in federal and by working with state and local governments to ease the regulatory we have helped to hold down housing costs and produce affordable as a result of these governmentwide million more american families bought homes in the past four years than in any equivalent period in and more than million homes have begun construction during my million more than in the previous four we have devoted particular effort to meeting the housing needs of low and moderate income in the past four more than million subsidized units have been made available for occupancy by lower income americans and more than assisted units have gone into in we have undertaken a series of measures to revitalize and preserve the million units of public and assisted for fiscal year i am proposing to continue our commitment to lower income i am requesting funds to support units of section and public maintaining these programs at the level provided by congress in fiscal while we have made progress in the past four in the future there are reasons for home price inflation and high interest rates threaten to put homeownership out of reach for lower income the elderly and those dependent upon rental housing face rising low levels of rental housing construction by historic and the threat of displacement due to conversion to condominiums and other housing will face strong competition for investment capital from the industrial sector generally and the energy in to address these i appointed a presidential task force and advisory group last while this effort will not proceed due to the election i hope the incoming administration will proceed with a similar the most important action government can take to meet housing needs is to restore stability to the economy and bring down the rate of inflation has driven up home operating costs and interest market uncertainty about inflation has contributed to the instability in interest which has been an added burden to homebuilders and homebuyers by making a commitment to provide a framework for greater sustained economic and price my administration has begun the work of creating a healthy environment for transportation with the passage of the airline deregulation act of the motor carrier act of and the harley staggers rail act of my working with the has initiated a new era of reduced regulation of transportation deregulation will lead to increased productivity and operating efficiencies in the industries and stimulate price and service to the benefit of consumers i urge the new administration to continue our efforts on behalf of deregulation legislation for the intercity passenger bus industry as in the coming the most significant challenge facing the nation in transportation services will be to improve a deteriorating physical infrastructure of waterways and mass transit in order to conserve costly energy supplies while promoting effective transportation highways our vast network of which account for percent of travel and percent by value of freight traffic goods is if current trends a major proportion of the interstate pavement will have deteriorated by the end of the arresting the deterioration of the system of highways is a high priority objective for the we must reorient the federal mission from major new construction projects to the stewardship of the existing interstate highway interstate gaps should be judged on the connections they make and on their compatibility with community during this highway investments will be needed to increase particularly in the elimination of provide more efficient connections to ports and seek solutions to traffic my administration has therefore recommended redefining completion of the interstate consolidating over categorical assistance programs into and initiating a major repair and rehabilitation program for segments of the interstate this effort should help maintain the condition and performance of the particularly the interstate and primary provide a realistic means to complete the interstate system by ensure better program delivery through and assist urban in the congress must address the urgent funding problems of the highway trust and the need to generate greater mass transit in the past decade the public transit ridership increased at an annual average of each year in the in continued increases in the cost of fuel are expected to make transit a growing part of the transportation as a my administration projected a ten billion program to increase mass transit capacity by and promote more energy efficient vehicle uses in the next the first part of this proposal was the five billion urban mass transportation administration reauthorization legislation i sent to the congress in i urge the congress to quickly enact this or similar legislation in my administration was also the first to have proposed and signed into law a formula grant program to assist rural areas and small communities with public transportation programs to end their dependence on the promote energy conservation and and provide transportation services to impoverished rural a principal need of the will be maintaining mobility for all segments of the population in the face of severely increasing transportation costs and uncertainty of fuel we must improve the flexibility of our transportation system and offer greater choice and diversity in transportation while the private automobile will continue to be the principal means of transportation for many public transportation can become an increasingly attractive want to explore a variety of paratransit various types of modern rapid regional rail systems and light rail highway planning and transit planning must be integrated and related to district and neighborhood planning efforts now in place or low density development and land use threaten the fiscal capacity of many communities to support needed services and elderly and handicapped transportation transportation policies in the must pay increasing attention to the needs of the elderly and by the number of people over will have grown from million to during the same the number of who have difficulty using transit as well as including the expected to increase from to making up percent of the we must not retreat from a policy that affords a significant and growing portion of our population accessible public transportation while recognizing that the handicapped are a diverse group and will need service where regular public transportation will not do the railroads in the federal government must reassess the appropriate federal role of support for passenger and freight rail services such as amtrak and our goal through federal assistance should be to maintain and enhance adequate rail where it is not otherwise available to needy but federal subsidies must be closely scrutinized to be sure they are a stimulus and not a replacement private investment and federal assistance cannot mean permanent subsidies for unprofitable waterways and rural transportation there is a growing need in rural and small communities for improved transportation rail freight service to many communities has declined as railroads abandon unproductive branch at the same rural roads are often inadequate to handle the increased demand for to service has also placed an increased burden on rural transportation while bottlenecks along the mississippi river delay grain shipments to the gulf of we have made some further develop the my administration began construction of a new foot lock at the site of lock and dam on the mississippi when opened in the new lock will have a capacity of million tons per an percent increase over the present the army corps of engineers has also undertaken studies to assess the feasibility of expanding the bonneville rehabilitation of john day lock was begun in and should be completed in my administration also supports the completion of the upper mississippi river master plan to determine the feasibility of constructing a second lock at these efforts will help alleviate delays in transporting soybeans and other goods along the mississippi river to the gulf of department of new small community and rural transportation policy will target federal assistance for passenger roads and truck and railroad freight service to rural this policy implements and expands upon the earlier white house transportation in rural announced in and the community and rural development announced in the congress should seek ways to balance rail branch line abandonment with the service needs of rural and farm provide financial assistance to rail branch line rehabilitation where assist shippers to adjust to rail branch line abandonment where it takes and help make it possible for trucking firms to serve light density markets with dependable and efficient trucking maritime policy during my administration i have sought to ensure that the maritime industry will not have to function at an unfair competitive disadvantage in the international as i indicated in my maritime policy statement to the congress in the american merchant marine is vital to our and federal actions should promote rather than harm in pursuit of this i signed into law the controlled carrier act of authorizing the federal maritime commission to regulate certain rate cutting practices of some and recently signed a bilateral maritime agreement with the republic of china that will expand the access of american ships to specified chinese and set aside for ships a substantial share least of the cargo between our this agreement should officially foster expanded and chinese shipping services linking the two and will provide further momentum to the growth of there is also a need to modernize and expand the dry bulk segment of our our heavy dependence on foreign carriage of cargoes deprives the economy of seafaring and shipbuilding adds to the deprives the government of substantial tax and leaves the united states dependent on shipping for a continued supply of raw materials to support the civil economy and war production in time of i therefore sent to the congress proposed legislation to strengthen this woefully weak segment of the fleet by removing certain disincentives to construction of dry bulkers and their operation under enactment of this proposed legislation would establish the basis for accelerating the rebuilding of the dry bulk fleet toward a level commensurate with the position of the united states as the leading bulk trading during the past year the administration has stated its support for legislation that would provide specific federal assistance for the installation of engines in existing american and would strengthen this shipbuilding mobilization strengthening the fleet is but we must also maintain our shipbuilding base for future ship provisions in existing laws calling for substantial or exclusive use of vessels to carry cargoes generated by the government must be vigorously i have therefore supported requirements that percent of oil purchased for the strategic petroleum reserve be transported in that the cargo preference act be applied to materials furnished for the assisted construction of air bases in and to cargoes transported pursuant to the chrysler corporation loan guarantee in the deep seabed hard mineral resources act requires that at least one ore carrier per mine site be a much has been and much remains to be the fy budget includes a million authorization for construction differential subsidy funds added to the unobligated cds balance of million from and the recently enacted million will provide an average of million in cds funds in and coal export policy while significant growth in foreign demand for steam coal is congestion at major coal exporting ports such as hampton and could delay and impede my administration has worked through the interagency coal task force which i to promote cooperation and coordination of resources between vessel operators and port and to determine the most appropriate federal role in expanding and modernizing coal export including dredging deeper channels at selected some progress has already been in addition to action taken by transshippers to reduce the number of coal classifications used whenever by the norfolk and western railroad to upgrade its computer capability to quickly inventory its coal cars in its and by the chessie railroad which is reactivating pier in newport news and has established a berth near its curtis bay pier in baltimore to decrease delays in vessel public activities will million plan developed by the state of pennsylvania and conrail to increase coal handling capacity at proposal by the state of virginia to construct a steam coal port on the craney island disposal area in portsmouth by which operates the only publicly owned coal terminal in the to enlarge its capacity at mcduffie island to million tons ground storage and car unit train unloading at new orleans of steam coal facilities that are expected to add over million tons of annual capacity by and corps of working with other interested federal will determine which ports should be to what depth and on what in order to accommodate larger coal carrying private industry of play a major role in developing the united coal export the new administration should continue to work to eliminate transportation bottlenecks that impede our access to foreign special needs women the past four years have been years of rapid advancement for our focus has been to provide american women with a full range of opportunities and to make them a part of the mainstream of every aspect of our national life and i have appointed a record number of women to judgeships and to top government fully percent of all my appointees are and i nominated of the women who sit on the federal bench for the first time in our women occupy policymaking positions at the highest level of every federal agency and department and have demonstrated their ability to serve our citizens we have strengthened the rights of employed women by consolidating and strengthening enforcement of sex discrimination laws under the by expanding employment rights of pregnant women through the pregnancy disability and by increasing federal employment opportunities for women through civil service and and by executive i created the first national program to provide women businessowners with technical and improved access to federal we have been sensitive to the needs of women who are i established an office of families within hhs and sponsored the white house conference on we initiated a program targeting ceta funds to help displaced the social security system was amended to eliminate the penalty and a comprehensive study of discriminatory provisions and possible changes was presented to legislation was passed to give divorced spouses of foreign service officers rights to share in pension we created an office on domestic violence within hhs to coordinate the agencies that now have domestic violence relief and to distribute information on the problem and the services available to despite a stringent budget for fy the administration consistently supported the educational equity act and family planning as well as other programs that affect such as food and social we have been concerned not only about the american but ensuring equality for women around the in i sent to the senate the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against this united nations document is the most comprehensive and detailed international agreement which seeks the advancement of on i have sought the counsel of men and women in and out of government and from all regions of our i established two the advisory committee for women and the interdepartmental task force on advise me on these the mandate for both groups expired on december but they have left behind a comprehensive review of the status of women in our society that review provides excellent guidance for the work remaining in our battle against sex even though we have made much remains on the agenda for i remain committed to the equal rights amendment and will continue to work for its it is essential to the goal of bringing women fully into the mainstream of american life that the era be the efforts begun for women in business and education should be continued and money should be available to states to establish programs to help the victims of domestic congress should pass a national health care plan and a welfare reform and these measures should reflect the needs of the talents of women should continue to be used to the fullest inside and outside of and efforts should continue to see that they have the widest range of opportunities and handicapped i hope that my administration will be remembered in this area for leading the way toward full civil rights for handicapped when i took no federal agency had yet issued as i leave this first step by every major agency and department in the federal government is almost but it is only a first the years ahead will require steadfast dedication by the president to protect and promote these precious rights in the in the and in all public facilities so that handicapped individuals may join the american mainstream and contribute to the fullest their resources and talents to our economic and social just as we in an unprecedented the civil rights of disabled persons in schools and in the other initiatives in health such as our immunization and nutrition programs for young children and new intense efforts to reverse spinal cord must continue so that the incidence of disability continues to this year is the international year of disabled we are organizing activities to celebrate and promote this important commemorative year within the government as well as in cooperation with private sector efforts in this country and around the the international year will give our country the opportunity to recognize the talents and capabilities of our fellow citizens with we can also share our rehabilitation and treatment skills with other countries and learn from them as i am proud that the united states leads the world in mainstreaming and treating disabled we have a long way to go before all psychological and physical barriers to disabled people are torn down and they can be full participants in our american way of we must pledge our full commitment to this goal during the international families because of my concern for american my administration convened last year the first white house conference on families which involved seven national over state and local three white house and the direct participation of more than the conference reaffirmed the centrality of families in our lives and nation but documented problems american families face as we also established the office of families within the department of health and human services to review government policies and programs that affect i expect the departments and agencies within the executive branch of the federal government as well as members of corporate and business and state and local officials across the to study closely the recommendations of the white house conference and implement them as public policy is developed and implemented by the federal cognizance of the work of the conference should be taken as a pragmatic and essential the conference has done a good job of establishing an agenda for action to assure that the policies of the federal government are more sensitive in their impact on i hope the congress will review and seriously consider the older americans my administration has taken great strides toward solving the difficult problems faced by older early in my term we worked successfully with the congress to assure adequate revenues for the social security trust and last year the strength of the social security system was strengthened by legislation i proposed to permit borrowing among the separate trust i have also signed into law legislation prohibiting employers from requiring retirement prior to age and removing mandatory retirement for most federal in my administration worked very closely with congress to amend the older americans act in a way that has already improved administration of its social food and employment this i will be submitting to congress a budget which again demonstrates my commitment to programs for the it will as my previous budgets increased funding for senior centers and home health and will focus added resources on the needs of older with the white house conference on aging i hope the new administration will make every effort to assure an effective and useful this conference should enable older americans to voice their concerns and give us guidance in our continued efforts to ensure the quality of life so richly deserved by our senior refugees we cannot hope to build a just and humane society at home if we ignore the humanitarian claims of their lives at who have nowhere else to our country can be proud that hundreds of thousands of people around the world would risk everything they their own come to our this administration initiated and implemented the first comprehensive reform of our refugee and immigration policies in over we also established the first refugee coordination office in the department of state under the leadership of a special ambassador and coordinator for refugee affairs and the new legislation and the office will bring common sense and consolidation to our previously and in many refugee and immigration with the unexpected arrival of thousands of cubans and haitians who sought refuge in our country last outside of our regular immigration and refugee admissions our country and its government were tested in being compassionate and responsive to a major human because we had taken steps to reorganize our refugee we met that test i am proud that the american people responded to this crisis with their traditional good will and we would never have been able to handle this unprecedented emergency without the efforts of the private resettlement agencies who have always been there to help refugees in immigrants to this country always contribute more toward making our country stronger than they ever take from the i am confident that the newest arrivals to our country will carry on this while we must remain committed to aiding and assisting those who come to our at the same time we must uphold our immigration and refugee policies and provide adequate enforcement as a result of our enforcement the illegal flow from cuba has been halted and an orderly process has been initiated to make certain that our refugee and immigration laws are this year the select commission on immigration and refugee policy will complete its work and forward its advice and i hope that the recommendations will be carefully considered by the new administration and the for it is clear that we must take additional action to keep our immigration policy responsive to emergencies and ever changing veterans this country and its leadership has a continuing and unique obligation to the men and women who served their nation in the armed forces and help maintain or restore peace in the my commitment to as evidenced by my is characterized by a conscientious and consistent emphasis in these general we have worked to honor the vietnam during my and under the leadership of va administrator max i was proud to lead our country in an overdue acknowledgement of our gratitude to the men and women who served their country during the bitter war in southeast their homecoming was deferred and seemed doomed to be our country has matured in the last four years and at long last we were able to separate the war from the warrior and honor these but with our acknowledgement of their service goes an understanding that some vietnam veterans have unique needs and my administration was able to launch a long sought after psychological readjustment and outreach unprecedented in its sensitivity and this program must be the administration has also grappled with the difficult questions posed by some veterans who served in southeast asia and were exposed to potentially harmful including the herbicide known as agent we have launched scientific inquiries that should answer many questions about their health and should provide the basis for establishing sound compensation we cannot rest until their concerns are dealt with in a expeditious and compassionate we have focused the va health care system in the needs of the disabled we initiated and are implementing the first reform of the va vocational rehabilitation system since its inception in my administration was the first to seek a increase for the recipients of va compensation every my last budget also makes such a the administration also launched the disabled veterans outreach program in the department of labor which has successfully placed disabled veterans in services provided by the va health care system will be further targeted to the special needs of disabled veterans during the coming the va health care the largest in the free has maintained its independence and high quality during my we have made the system more efficient and have therefore treated more veterans than ever before by concentrating on care and through modern management as the median age of the american veteran population we must concentrate on further changes within the va system to keep it independent and to serve as a model to the nation and to the world as a center for treatment and government assistance general aid to state and local governments since taking i have been strongly committed to strengthening the fiscal and economic condition of our state and local i have accomplished this goal by encouraging economic development of local and by supporting the general revenue sharing and other essential to states and localities during my total to state and local governments have increased by more than from billion in fiscal year to billion in fiscal year this significant increase in aid has allowed states and localities to maintain services that are essential to their citizens without imposing onerous tax it also has allowed us to establish an unprecedented partnership between the leaders of the federal government and state and local government elected general revenue sharing last year congress enacted legislation that extends the general revenue sharing program for three more this program is the cornerstone of our efforts to maintain the fiscal health of our local it will provide billion in each of the next three years to counties and this program is essential to the continued ability of our local governments to provide essential fire and sanitation this legislation renewing grs will be the cornerstone of government relations in the this policy will emphasize the need for all levels of government to cooperate in order to meet the needs of the most fiscally strained cities and and also will emphasize the important role that grs can play in forging this i am grateful that congress moved quickly to assure that our localities can begin the in sound fiscal assistance last i proposed that congress enact a billion fiscal assistance program to protect states and localities from unexpected changes in the national this program unfortunately was not enacted by the have not included funding for aid in my fiscal year i urge congress to enact a permanent so that states and cities can be protected during the next economic urban policy three years i proposed the first comprehensive urban that policy involved more than one hundred improvements in existing federal four new executive orders and nineteen pieces of with sixteen of these bills have now been signed into economic development one of the principal goals of my domestic policy has been to strengthen the private sector economic base of our economically troubled urban and rural with we have substantially expanded the federal economic development programs and provided new tax incentives for private investment in urban and rural these programs have helped many communities to attract new private sector jobs and investments and to retain the jobs and investments that already are in when i took the federal government was spending less than million annually on economic development and only million of those funds in our urban since that we have created the urban development action grant program and substantially expanded the economic development programs in the commerce my fy budget requests more than billion for economic development loans and interest subsidies and almost billion for loan approximately percent of these funds will be spent in our urban in we have extended the percent investment credit to include rehabilitation of existing industrial facilities as well as new i continue to believe that the development of private sector investment and jobs is the key to revitalizing our economically depressed urban and rural to ensure that the necessary economic development goes the congress must continue to provide strong support for the udag program and the programs for the economic development those programs provide a foundation for the economic development of our nation in the community development the partnership among state and local governments to revitalize our communities has been a high priority of my when i took i proposed a substantial expansion of the community development block grant program and the enactment of a new million urban development action grant both of these programs have provided essential community and economic development assistance to our cities and last congress reauthorized both the cdbg and udag the cdbg program was reauthorized for three more years with annual funding increases of and the udag program was extended for three years at the current funding level of million my budget requests full funding for both of these these actions should help our cities and counties to continue the progress they have made in the last three neighborhoods during my administration we have taken numerous positive steps to achieve a full partnership of neighborhood organizations and government at all we have successfully fought against red lining and housing we created innovative self help funding and technical resource transfer we have created unique methods of access for neighborhood organizations to have a participating role in federal and state government neighborhood based organizations are the threshold of the american the federal government will need to develop more innovative and practical ways for neighborhood based organizations to successfully participate in the identification and solution of local and neighborhood full partnership will only be achieved with the knowing participation of leaders of education and neither state nor federal solutions imposed from on high will neighborhoods are the fabric and soul of this great neighborhoods define the weave that has been used to create a permanent the federal government must take every opportunity to provide access and influence to the individuals and organizations affected at the neighborhood rural policy since the beginning of my i have been committed to improving the effectiveness with which the federal government deals with the problems and needs of a rapidly changing rural the rapid growth of some rural areas has placed a heavy strain on communities and their there are also persistent problems of poverty and economic stagnation in other parts of rural some rural areas continue to lose as they have for the past several in i announced the small community and rural development it was the culmination of several work and was designed to address the varying needs of our rural in my administration worked with the congress to pass the rural development policy act of which when fully implemented will allow us to meet the needs of rural people and their communities more effectively and more as a result of the policy and the accompanying we the position of under secretary of agriculture for small community and rural development to provide overall a white house working group to assist in the implementation of the with more than governors to form state rural development councils to work in partnership with the white house working and the federal to better deliver state and federal programs to rural the white house working group to annually review existing and proposed and budget levels to determine their adequacy in meeting rural needs and the fulfilling of the objectives and this effort on the part of my administration and the congress has resulted in a landmark for the first rural affairs has received the prominence it has always it is a policy that can truly help alleviate the diverse and differing problems rural america will face in the with the help and dedication of a great many people around the country who are concerned with rural we have constructed a mechanism for dealing effectively with rural there is now a great opportunity to successfully combine federal efforts with the efforts of rural community leaders and it is my hope this spirit of cooperation and record of accomplishment will be continued in the coming consumers in i signed an executive order designed to strengthen and coordinate federal consumer programs and to establish procedures to improve and facilitate consumer participation in government forty federal agencies have adopted programs to comply with the requirements of the these programs will improve complaint provide better information to enhance opportunities for public participation in government and assure that the consumer point of view is considered in all and while substantial progress has been made in assuring a consumer presence in federal work must continue to meet fully the goals of the executive close monitoring of agency compliance with the requirements of the order is continued evaluation to assure that the programs are effective and making maximum use of available resources is also as a complement to these efforts to provide financial assistance in regulatory proceedings to citizen small and others whose participation is limited by their economic circumstances must continue to be it is essential that consumer representatives in government pay particular attention to the needs and interests of consumers and the office of consumer what communities are doing to counter catalogues some of the ways that government and the private sector can assist the less powerful in our society to help new ways should be found to help foster this new movement which is founded on the principle of science and technology science and technology contribute immeasurably to the lives of all our high standard of living is largely the product of the technology that surrounds us in the home or our good health is due in large part to our ever increasing scientific our national security is assured by the application pate science and technology will the federal government has a special role to play in science and although the fruits of scientific achievements surround it is often difficult to predict the benefits that will arise from a given scientific and these even if do not usually lead to ownership the government has a special obligation to support science as an investment in our my administration has sought to reverse a decline in despite the need for fiscal real support of basic research has grown nearly during my term in my administration has sought to increase the support of research in the variety of mission in this we can harness the american genius for innovation to meet the and security challenges that confront our relations and national science and technology are becoming increasingly important elements of our national security and foreign this is especially so in the current age of sophisticated defense systems and of growing dependence among all countries on modern technology for all aspects of their economic for these scientific and technological considerations have been integral elements of the on such national security and foreign policy issues as the modernization of our strategic arms technology the growing bilateral relationship with and our relations with the developing four themes have shaped policy in international scientific and technological pursuit of new international initiatives to advance our own research and development development and strengthening of scientific exchange to bridge politically and cultural divisions between this country and other formulation of programs and institutional relations to help developing countries use science and technology and cooperation with other nations to manage technologies with local at my my science and technology adviser has actively pursued international programs in support of these four we have given special attention to scientific and technical relations with to new forms of scientific and technical cooperation with to cooperation with other latin american and caribbean countries and several states in black and to the proposed institute for scientific and technological in particular our cooperation with developing countries reflects the importance that each of them has placed on the relationship between economic growth and scientific and technological it also reflects their view that the great strength of the in science and technology makes close relations with the technical community an especially productive means of enhancing this scientific and technological assistance is a key linkage between the and the developing a linkage that has been in the past and one which we must continue to work to the administration has established a framework for a strong and evolving space program for the the space policy reaffirmed the separation of military space systems and the open civil space and at the same provided new guidance on technology transfer between the civil and military the civil space program centers on three basic our space policy will reflect a balanced strategy of and technology activities will be pursued when they can be uniquely or more efficiently accomplished in a premature commitment to a high initiative of the complexity of apollo is as the shuttle development phases there will be added flexibility to consider new space space science and new space exploration the shuttle dominates our technology development effort and correctly it represents one of the most sophisticated technological challenges ever and as a has encountered technical the first manned orbital flight is now scheduled for i have been pleased to support strongly the necessary funds for the shuttle throughout my since the has conducted experimental civil remote sensing through landsat thereby realizing many successful recognizing this i directed the implementation of an operational civil land satellite remote sensing with the operational management responsibility in national oceanic and atmospheric in

federal government and to more than half a million american i have worked to improve the relationship between the federal establishment and the government of the district of columbia in order to further the goals and spirit of home the city controls more of its own destiny than was the case four years despite the close cooperation between my administration and that of mayor we have not yet seen the necessary number of states ratify the constitutional amendment granting full voting representation in the congress to the citizens of this it is my hope that this inequity will be the country and the people who inhabit washington deserve no the arts the arts are a precious national federal support for the arts has been enhanced during my administration by expanding government funding and services to arts individual and teachers through the national endowment for the we have broadened its scope and reach to a more diverse we have also reactivated the federal council on the arts and it is my hope that during the coming years the new administration and the congress support of institutions promoting development and understanding of the business participants in a comprehensive effort to achieve a truly mixed economy of support for the a variety of mechanisms to nurture the creative talent of our citizens and build audiences for their active national endowments for the greater recognition for the rich cultural tradition of the grants for the arts in the humanities in recently reauthorizing federal appropriations for the national endowment for the the congress has once again reaffirmed that encouragement and support of national progress and scholarship in the humanities while primarily a matter for private and local is also an appropriate matter of concern to the federal and that high civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the a better analysis of the and a better view of the i believe we are in agreement that the humanities illuminate the values underlying important and national questions raised in our society by its multiple links to and increasing dependence on and by the diverse heritage of our many regions and ethnic the humanities cast light on the broad issue of the role in a society of men and women of imagination and individuals who through their own example define spirit of the and in so doing move our support for the within the framework laid down by the is a recognition of their essential nourishment of the life of the mind and vital enrichment of our national i will be proposing an increase in funding this year sufficient to enable the endowment to maintain the same level of support offered our citizens in fiscal year in the allocation of this special emphasis will be given education in the in response to the great needs that have arisen in this research designed to increase our understanding of the and historical forces at work in other nations and in our attention to the physical disintegration of the raw material of our cultural and other to the development of techniques to prevent the destruction and to preserve those and dissemination of quality programming in the humanities to increasingly large american audiences through the use of radio and the dominant effort in the expenditures will be a commitment to strengthen and promulgate scholarly excellence and achievement in work in the humanities in our museums and other cultural as well as in the work of individual scholars or collaborative groups engaged in advanced research in the in making its grants the endowment will increase its emphasis on techniques which stimulate support for the humanities from in order to reinforce our tradition of private philanthropy in this and to insure and expand the financial viability of our cultural institutions and insular areas i have been firmly committed to for puerto the virgin american samoa and the northern mariana and have vigorously supported the realization of whatever political status aspirations are democratically chosen by their this principle was the keystone of the comprehensive territorial policy i sent the congress last i am pleased that most of the legislative elements of that policy were endorsed by the the unique fragile and locations of our caribbean and pacific islands are distinct assets to the united states which require the sensitive application of the united states government should pursue initiatives begun by my administration and the congress to stimulate insular economic enhance treatment under federal programs eliminating current provide vitally needed special assistance and coordinate and rationalize these measures will result in greater and balanced in i hope that the new congress will support funding for fiscal comprehensive planning and other technical assistance for the as well as create the commission i have proposed to review the applicability of all federal laws to the insular areas and make recommendations for appropriate removing governmental waste and inefficiency one of my major commitments has been to restore public faith in our federal government by cutting out waste and in the past four we have made dramatic advances toward this many of them previously considered impossible to where government rules and operations were they have been as with trucking and financial where government functions are they have been through such landmark measures as the civil service reform act of i hope that the new administration and the congress will keep up the momentum we have established for effective and responsible change in this area of crucial public civil service reform in march i submitted the civil service reform act to i called it the centerpiece of my efforts to reform and reorganize the with bipartisan support from the bill and i am pleased to say that implementation is running well ahead of the statutory throughout the we are putting into place the means to assure that reward and retention are based on performance and not simply on length of time on the in the first real test of the reform percent of the eligible managers joined the senior executive choosing to relinquish job protections for the challenge and potential reward of this new corps of top though the act does not require several of its key elements to be in operation for another some federal agencies already have established merit pay systems for and most agencies are well on their way to establishing new performance standards for all their all have paid or are now in the process of paying performance bonuses earned by outstanding members of the senior executive dismissals have increased by and dismissals specifically for inadequate job performance have risen since the act was we have established a fully independent merit systems protection board and special counsel to protect the rights of and other federal employees faced with threats to their in civil service reform faces critical all agencies must have fully functioning performance appraisal systems for all and merit pay systems for compensating the performance bonuses for members of the senior executive service will surely receive if this attention is balanced and it can only enhance the chances for ultimate success of our bipartisan commitment to the revolutionary and crucial for regulatory reform during the past four years we have made tremendous progress in regulatory we have discarded old economic regulations that prevented competition and raised consumer and we have imposed strong management principles on the regulatory programs the country cutting paperwork and other wasteful the challenge for the future is to continue the progress in both areas without crippling vital health and safety our economic deregulation program has achieved major successes in five the airline deregulation act is generating healthy saving billions in and making the airlines more the act provides that in the cab itself will go out of the trucking deregulation bill opens the industry to competition and allows truckers wide latitude on the routes they drive and the goods they the bill also phases out most of the old immunity for setting the congressional budget office estimates these reforms will save as much as billion per year and cut as much as half a percentage point from the inflation overregulation has stifled railroad management and competitive the new legislation gives the railroads the freedom they need to rebuild a efficient railroad financial with the help of the over the past four years we have achieved two major pieces of financial reform legislation which has provided the basis for the most changes in the financial services industry since the the international banking act of was designed to reduce the advantages that foreign banks operating in the united states possessed in comparison to domestic the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control adopted last provides for the phased elimination of a variety of barriers to financial institutions and freedom to offer services to and attract the savings of especially small i submitted to the congress my recommendations for the phased liberalization of restrictions on geographic expansion by commercial last year the administration and financial regulatory agencies proposed legislation to permit the interstate acquisition of failing depository in view of the difficult outlook for some depository institutions i strongly urge the congress to take prompt favorable action on the failing bank while congress did not pass legislation in this the federal communications commission has taken dramatic action to open all aspects of communications to competition and to eliminate regulations in the areas where competition made them the public is benefitting from an explosion of competition and new while these initiatives represent dramatic progress in economic continued work is i urge congress to act on communications legislation and to consider other proposed deregulation such as legislation on the bus in the regulatory commissions must maintain their commitment to competition as the best regulator of the other part of my reform program covers the regulations that are needed to protect the and welfare of our for these my administration has created a management program to cut costs without sacrificing under my executive order we required agencies to analyze the costs of their major new rules and consider alternative such as performance standards and voluntary that may make rules less costly and more we created the regulatory analysis review group in the white house to analyze the most costly proposed new rules and find ways to improve the regulatory council was established to provide the first listing of upcoming rules and eliminate overlapping and conflicting agencies have launched programs to weed out outmoded old we have acted to encourage public participation in regulatory these steps have already saved billions of dollars in regulatory costs and slashed thousands of outmoded we are moving steadily toward a regulatory system that provides needed protections and at minimum i urge congress to continue on this steady path and resist the simplistic solutions that have been proposed as proposals like legislative veto and increased judicial review will add another layer to the regulatory making it more cumbersome and the right approach to reform is to improve the individual where they need and to ensure that the regulatory agencies implement those statutes paperwork reduction the federal government imposes a huge paperwork burden on local and the private many of these forms are needed for vital government but others are overly complex or during my administration we cut the paperwork burden by and we created procedures to continue this the new paperwork reduction act in oversight of all information requirements and strengthens authority to eliminate needless the which i established by executive applies the discipline of the budget process to the hours of reporting time imposed on the forcing agencies to scrutinize all their forms each with effective these steps should allow substantial paperwork cuts in the years tightening standards for governmental efficiency and integrity to develop a foundation to carry out energy we consolidated scattered energy programs and launched the synthetic fuels to give education the priority it deserves and at the same time reduce hhs to more manageable i gave education a seat at the cabinet to create a stronger system for attacking waste and i reorganized audit and investigative functions by putting an inspector general in major since i took we have submitted reorganization initiatives and had them all approved by we have saved hundreds of millions of dollars through the adoption of businesslike cash management principles and set strict standards for personal financial disclosure and conflict of interest avoidance by high federal to streamline the structure of the we have secured approval of reorganization improving the efficiency of the most important sectors of the including and civil rights we have eliminated more than advisory committees as well as other boards and commissions which were obsolete or independent inspectors general have been appointed in major agencies to attack fraud and more than a billion dollars of questionable transactions have been identified through their audit the adoption of cash management and debt collection initiatives will save over by streamlining the processing of by controlling disbursements more and by reducing idle cash finally this administration has set strict standards for personal financial disclosure and conflict of interest avoidance by high federal to elevate the level of public trust in the protecting basic rights and liberties i am extremely proud of the advances we have made in ensuring equality and protecting the basic freedoms of all equal employment opportunity commission and the office of federal contract compliance have been reorganized and strengthened and a permanent civil rights unit has been established in avoid inconsistent and duplicative enforcement of civil rights three agencies have been given coordinative and responsibilities in discrete eeoc for all hud for all those relating to and the department of justice for all other the enactment of the right to financial privacy act and a bill limiting police search of we have begun to establish a privacy ratification of the equal rights amendment must be aggressively only one year remains in which to obtain ratification by three additional the congress must give early attention to a number of important bills which these bills the laws against discrimination in until it is the civil rights promise of equal access to housing will remain a charter for the fbi and the intelligence the failure to define in law the duties and responsibilities of these agencies has made possible some of the abuses which have occurred in recent privacy safeguards for medical and credit and provide special protection for election fund transfer equal rights amendment i remain committed as strongly as possible to the ratification of the equal rights as a result of our efforts in the equal rights deadline for ratification was extended for three we have now one year and three states we cannot afford any delay in marshalling our resources and efforts to obtain the ratification of those three additional although the congress has no official role in the ratification process at this you do have the ability to affect public opinion and the support of state legislators for the i urge members from states which have not yet ratified the equal rights amendment to use their influence to secure i will continue my own efforts to help ensure ratification of the equal rights martin luther martin luther led this effort to provide all its citizens with civil rights and equal his commitment to human peace and stands as a monument to his humanity and as one of our most outstanding it is appropriate that his birthday be commemorated as a national i hope the congress will enact legislation this year that will achieve this fair housing the fair housing act amendments of passed the house of representatives by an overwhelming bipartisan majority only to die in the senate at the close of the the leaders of both parties have pledged to make the enactment of fair housing legislation a top priority of the incoming the need is pressing and a strengthened federal enforcement effort must be the primary method of criminal code the federal criminal laws are often frequently contradictory and and clearly in need of revision and the new administration should continue the work which has been begun to develop a federal criminal code which simplifies and clarifies our criminal while maintaining our basic civil liberties and privacy as our public and private institutions collect more and more information and as communications and computer technologies we must act to protect the personal privacy of our in the past four years we acted on the report of the privacy commission and established a national privacy we worked with congress to pass legislation restricting wiretaps and law enforcement access to bank records and to we reduced the number of personal files held by the government and restricted the transfer of personal information among federal we also worked with the organization for economic cooperation and development to establish international guidelines to protect the privacy of personal information that is transferred across protecting and developing our natural resources two of our most precious natural resources are our environment and our vast agricultural from the beginning of my i have worked with the congress to enhance and as well as develop our natural in the environmental i have been especially concerned about the importance of balancing the need for resource development with preserving a clean and have taken numerous actions to foster this in the agricultural i have taken the steps needed to improve farm incomes and to increase our agricultural production to record that progress must be continued in the environment preserving the quality of our environment has been among the most important objectives of my administration and of the as a result of these shared commitments and the dedicated efforts of many members of the congress and my we have achieved several historic protection of alaska lands passage of the alaska national interest lands conservation act was one of the most important conservation actions of this at stake was the fate of millions of acres of beautiful outstanding and unique wildlife native and the opportunity to ensure that future generations of americans would be able to enjoy the benefits of these nationally significant as a result of the and persistence of my administration and the congressional the alaska lands bill was signed into law last the act adds million acres of new parks and more than doubling the size of our national park and national wildlife refuge the bill triples the size of our national wilderness increasing its size by million and by adding river segments to the wild and scenic river the bill almost doubles the river mileage in that the alaska lands act reaffirms our commitment to the environment and strikes a balance between protecting areas of great beauty and allowing development of and timber protection of natural resources in addition to the alaska lands over the past four years we have been able to expand significantly the national wilderness and parks in the congress passed the historical omnibus parks which made additions to the national park the act also established the first two national trails since the national trails system act was passed in in as a result of my environmental the federal land management agencies have established almost new national recreational with the completion of the rare ii which eliminated the uncertainty surrounding the status of millions of acres of we called for over million acres of new wilderness in the national in the congress established about million acres of wilderness in the lower in the administration recommended legislation to protect lake and through an executive order has already established a mechanism to help ensure the in the administration established the channel islands marine administration actions over the past four years stressed the importance of providing federal support only for water resource projects that are economically and environmentally this policy should have a major and lasting influence on the federal role in water resource development and the actions to recommend to the congress only economically and environmentally sound water resource projects for funding resulted not only in our opposing uneconomic projects but in in the first administration proposal of new project starts in one of the most significant water policy actions of the past four years was the june water policy reform message to the this message established a new national water resources policy with the following give priority emphasis to water consider environmental requirements and values more fully and along with economic factors in the planning and management of water projects and enhance cooperation between state and federal agencies in water resources planning and in the executive office of the president established policy decision criteria to evaluate the proposed federal water the water resources council developed and adopted a new set of principles and standards for water projects which is binding on all federal construction and improved regulations were developed to implement the national historic preservation act and the fish and wildlife coordination as a water resource projects must be determined to be economically sound before the administration will recommend authorization or over the years this policy will help to reduce wasteful federal spending by targeting federal funds to the highest priority water resource in the pursuit of this we cannot lose in the part that sound water resource projects play in providing and flood we must also recognize the special needs of particular regions of the country in evaluating the need for additional addressing global resource and environmental problems the global report to the prepared in response to my environment is the first of its never before has our or any taken such a look at the interrelated global issues of and the conclusions are they point to a rapid increase in population and human needs through the year while at the same time a decline in the capacity to meet those unless nations of the world act decisively to alter current the united states has contributed actively to a series of conferences on the and and is preparing for the conference on new and renewable sources of following my environmental the administration development assistance programs have added emphasis to natural resource management and environmental my environmental message called attention to the alarming loss of world particularly in the an interagency task force on tropical forests has developed a government program to encourage conservation and wise management of tropical the administration is encouraging action by other nations and world organizations to the same the united states is a world leader in wildlife conservation and the assessment of environmental effects of government the january executive order directing government agencies to consider the effects of their major actions is another example of this commitment to control of pollution and hazardous chemicals over the past four there has been steady progress towards cleaner air and sustained by the commitment of congress and the administration to these important national in the administration has developed several new pollution compliance approaches such as alternative and innovative waste water treatment the the and permit all of which are designed to reduce regulatory burdens on the private one of the most pressing problems to come to light in the past four years has been improper hazardous waste the administration has moved on three we proposed the oil hazardous substances and hazardous waste liability and compensation act superfund to provide comprehensive authority and billion in funds to clean up abandoned hazardous waste disposal in november the congress passed a superfund bill which i signed into the administration established a hazardous waste enforcement strike force to ensure that when responsible parties are required to clean up sites posing dangers to public health and to the to lawsuits have been brought by the strike regulations implementing subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act were the regulations establish comprehensive controls for hazardous waste together with vigorous will help to ensure that love canal will not be the future for the we and we must forget that we are charged with the stewardship of an irreplaceable environment and natural our and our are dependent upon our maintaining our commitment to preserving and enhancing the quality of our it is my hope that when our descendants look back on the they will be able to we kept our commitment to the restoration of environmental we protected the public health from the continuing dangers of toxic from from hazardous and radioactive and that we made our communities healthier and better places to we preserved wilderness areas and particularly its last great for the benefit of all americans in we put this nation on a path to a sustainable energy one based increasingly on renewable resources and on energy we moved to protect countryside and coastland from mismanagement and we redirected the management of the water resources toward water sound development and environmental we faced squarely such worldwide problems as the destruction of acid carbon dioxide and nuclear and we protected the habitat and the existence of our own species on this agriculture the farm economy the farm economy is sound and its future is agriculture remains a major bulwark of the economy and an even more important factor in the world food the demand for agricultural here and continues to in the the strength of this demand is expected to press hard against resulting in continued price the health and vitality of agriculture represents a significant departure from the situation that existed when i came to office four years in january the farm economy was in serious farm prices and farm income were falling grain prices were at their lowest levels in years and steadily livestock in their fourth straight year of record were liquidating breeding herds at an unparalleled dairy farmers were losing money on every hundredweight of milk they sugar prices were in a through a combination of improvements in established programs and the adoption of new approaches where innovation and change were my administration turned this situation commodity prices have steadily farm income turned farm exports set new records each increasing over percent for the four year livestock producers began rebuilding their dairy farmers began to earn a profit recent policy initiatives several major agricultural policy initiatives have been undertaken over the past some are the culmination of policy proposals made earlier in this others are measures taken to help farmers offset the impact of rapid inflation in production in they represent a significant strengthening of our food and agricultural these initiatives food security reserve the congress authorized formation of a million ton food grain reserve for use in international food this reserve makes it possible for the united states to stand behind its food aid commitment to food deficit even during periods of short supplies and high this corrects a serious fault in our past food assistance comprehensive crop insurance the congress also authorized a significant new crop insurance program during this measure provides farmers with an important new program tool for sharing the economic risks that are inherent to when fully it will replace a hodgepodge of disaster programs that suffered from numerous special loan rates another legislative measure passed late in the session of the congress authorizes the secretary of agriculture to provide higher loan rates to farmers who enter their grain in the grain this additional incentive to participate will further strengthen the increased loan prices in july i administratively raised loan prices for and soybeans to help offset the effects of a serious at the same the release and call prices for the grain reserve were adjusted higher target prices the agricultural adjustment act of raised the target prices for wheat and feed grain this change corrected for shortcomings in the adjustment formula contained in the food and agriculture act of future agenda the food and agricultural policies adopted by this administration over the past four including those described will provide a firm foundation for future governmental actions in this expiration of the food and agriculture act of later this year will require early attention by the with relatively minor most of the authorities contained in the act should be extended in their present the grain reserve has proven to be a particularly effective means of stabilizing grain markets and should be preserved in essentially its present beyond it will be important for the congress to keep a close eye on developments in the farm as noted some of the actions i took last year were for the purpose of providing relief from the squeeze facing should these pressures further actions might be my administration has devoted particular attention to the issues of world agricultural land and the future structure of american i encourage the congress and the next administration to review the results of these landmark enquiries where deemed to act on their following a careful review of the i recently extended the suspension of grain sales to the soviet i am satisfied that this action has served its purpose effectively and as long as this suspension must remain in it will be important for the next administration and the congress to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the burden does not fall unfairly on our this has been a key feature of my and it should be foreign policy from the time i assumed office four years ago this i have stressed the need for this country to assert a leading role in a world undergoing the most extensive and intensive change in human my policies have been directed in particular at three areas of steady growth and increased projection abroad of soviet military power that has grown faster than our own over the past two overwhelming dependence of western which now increasingly includes the united on vital oil supplies from the middle pressures of change in many nations of the developing in iran and uncertainty about the future stability of many developing as a result of those fundamental we face some of the most serious challenges in the history of this the soviet invasion of afghanistan is a threat to global to and to regional stable flow of as the unprecedented an and overwhelming vote in the general assembly countries across the and particularly the regard the soviet invasion as a threat to their independence and turmoil within the region adjacent to the persian gulf poses risks for the security and prosperity of every oil importing nation and thus for the entire global the continuing holding of american hostages in iran is both an affront to civilized people and a serious impediment to meeting the threat to common including those of but as we focus our most urgent efforts on pressing we will continue to pursue the benefits that only change can for it always has been the essence of america that we want to move we understand that progress and most of all peace cannot be had by standing a world of nations striving to preserve their and of peoples aspiring for economic development and political is not a world hostile to the ideals and interests of the united we face powerful but we have strong friends and dependable we have common interests with the vast majority of the nations and there have been encouraging developments in recent as well as matters requiring continued vigilance and alliances with the most advanced and democratic states from western europe through japan are stronger than have helped to bring about a dramatic improvement in relations between egypt and israel and an historic step towards a comprehensive relations with china are growing providing a major new dimension in our policy in asia and the southern africa from rhodesia to namibia we are helping with the peaceful transition to majority rule in a context of respect for minority as well as majority have worked domestically and with our allies to respond to an uncertain energy situation by conservation and diversification of energy supplies based on internationally agreed have unambiguously demonstrated our commitment to defend western interests in southwest and we have significantly increased our ability to do over the past four years the has developed an energy program which is comprehensive and new institutions have been established such as the synthetic fuels corporation and solar price decontrol for oil and gas is american consumers have risen to the and we have experienced real improvements in consumption the central challenge for us today is to our steadfastedness of we are no longer tempted by but we must also learn to deal effectively with the contradictions of the the need to cooperate with potential adversaries without without undermining our determination to compete with such adversaries and if necessary confront the threats they may pose to our we face a broad range of threats and we have and should continue to pursue a broad range of diplomatic and economic capabilities and i see six basic goals for america in the world over the we will as we have over the past four to build military strength and that of our allies and neither the soviet union nor any other nation will have reason to question our will to sustain the strongest and most flexible defense we will pursue an active diplomacy in the together with our friends and to resolve disputes through peaceful means and to make any aggressor pay a heavy we will strive to resolve pressing international economic particularly energy and and continue to pursue our still larger objective of global economic growth through expanded trade and development assistance and through the preservation of an open multilateral trading we will continue vigorously to support the process of building democratic institutions and improving human rights protection around the we are deeply convinced that the future lies not with dictatorship but we remain deeply committed to the process of mutual and verifiable arms particularly to the effort to prevent the spread and further development of nuclear our decision to but not abandon our efforts to secure ratification of the salt ii treaty reflects our firm conviction that the united states has a profound national security interest in the constraints on soviet nuclear forces which only that treaty can we must continue to look ahead in order to evaluate and respond to environment and population challenges through the end of this one very immediate and pressing objective that is uppermost on our minds and those of the american people is the release of our hostages in we have no basic quarrel with the the revolution or the people of the threat to them comes not from american policy but from soviet actions in the we are prepared to work with the government of iran to develop a new and mutually beneficial but that will not be possible so long as iran continues to hold americans in defiance of the world community and civilized they must be released we have thus far pursued a measured program of peaceful diplomatic and economic steps in an attempt to resolve this issue without resorting to other remedies available to us under international this reflects the deep respect of our nation for the rule of law and for the safety of our people being and our belief that a great power bears a responsibility to use its strength in a measured and judicious but our patience is not unlimited and our concern for the of our fellow citizens grows each enhancing national american military strength the maintenance of national security is my first as it has been for every president before we must have both the military power and the political will to deter our adversaries and to support our friends and we must pay whatever price is required to remain the strongest nation in the that price has increased as the military power of our major adversary has grown and its readiness to use that power been made all too evident in the real increases in defense therefore probably will be higher than previously protecting our security may require a larger share of our national wealth in the the relationship we are demonstrating to the soviet union across a broad front that it will pay a heavy price for its aggression in terms of our throughout the last decades relations have been a mixture of cooperation and the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the imposition of a puppet government have highlighted in the starkest terms the darker side of their going well beyond competition and the legitimate pursuit of national and violating all norms of international law and this attempt to subjugate an islamic people is a callous violation of international law and the united nations two fundamentals of international it is also a dangerous threat to world for the first time since the communization of eastern europe after world war the soviets have sent combat forces into an area that was not previously under their into a and sovereign the destruction of the independence of the afghanistan government and the occupation by the soviet union have altered the strategic situation in that part of the world in a very ominous it has significantly shortened the striking distance to the indian ocean and the persian gulf for the soviet it has also eliminated a buffer between the soviet union and pakistan and presented a new threat to these two countries are now far more vulnerable to soviet political if that intimidation were to prove the soviet union could control an area of vital strategic and economic significance to the survival of western the far and ultimately the united it has now been over a year since the soviet invasion of afghanistan dealt a major blow to relations and the entire international the response has proven to be serious and it has been increasingly imposing real and sustained costs on the economy and international we have encouraged and supported efforts to reach a political settlement in afghanistan which would lead to a withdrawal of soviet forces from that country and meet the interests of all it is soviet intransigence that has kept those efforts from bearing an overwhelming november resolution of the united nations general assembly on afghanistan has again made clear that the world has not and will not forget and our response continues to make it clear that soviet use of force in pursuit of its international objectives is incompatible with the notion of bilateral communication relations remain strained by the continued soviet presence in by growing soviet military and by the apparent willingness to use those capabilities without respect for the most basic norms of international but the relationship remains the single most important element in determining whether there will be war or and despite serious strains in our we have maintained a dialogue with the soviet union over the past through this we have ensured against bilateral misunderstandings and miscalculations which might escalate out of and have managed to avoid the injection of superpower rivalries into areas of tension like the poland as was the case a year the prospect of soviet use of force threatens the international the soviet union has completed preparations for a possible military intervention against although the situation in poland has shown signs of stabilizing soviet forces remain in a high state of readiness and they could move into poland on short we continue to believe that the polish people should be allowed to work out their internal problems without outside and we have made clear to the soviet leadership that any intervention in poland would have severe and prolonged consequences for and relations in defense budget for many years the soviets have steadily increased their real defense expanded their strategic strengthened their forces in europe and and enhanced their capability for projecting military force around the world directly or through the use of afghanistan dramatizes the vastly increased military power of the soviet the soviet union has built a war machine far beyond any reasonable requirements for their own defense and in our own defense spending declined in real terms every year from through we have reversed this decline in our own every year since there has been a real increase in our defense and our lead has encouraged increases by our with the support of the we must and will make an even greater effort in the years the fiscal year budget would increase funding authority for defense to more than this together with a supplemental request for fy of about will more than meet my pledge for a sustained growth of percent in real and provides for percent in program growth in fy and the trends we mean to correct cannot be remedied we must be willing to see this program to ensure that we do so i am setting a growth rate for defense that we can sustain over the long the defense program i have proposed for the next five years will require some but sacrifice we can well the defense program emphasizes four it ensures that our strategic nuclear forces will be equivalent to those of the soviet union and that deterrence against nuclear war will be it upgrades our forces so that the military balance between nato and the warsaw pact will continue to deter the outbreak of conventional or in it provides us the ability to come quickly to the aid of friends and allies around the and it ensures that our navy will continue to be the most powerful on the strategic forces we are strengthening each of the three legs of our strategic the cruise missile production which will begin next year will modernize our strategic air capabilities will also be these steps will maintain and enhance the fleet by improving its ability to deliver weapons against increasingly heavily defended we are also modernizing our strategic submarine four more poseidon submarines backfitted with mile trident i missiles began deployments in nine trident submarines have been authorized through and we propose one more each the new missile program to enhance our intercontinental ballistic missile force continues to make technical refinements in the basing design over the last year will result in operational lower and reduced environmental the program continues to be an essential ingredient in our strategic providing secure command and control and the capability to threaten targets the soviets hold our new systems will enable strategic forces to maintain equivalence in the face of the mounting soviet we would however need an even greater investment in strategic systems to meet the likely soviet buildup without strategic doctrine this systematic contributions to the necessary evolution of strategic doctrine began in when i commissioned a comprehensive net from that base a number of thorough investigations of specific topics i should emphasize that the need for an evolutionary doctrine is driven not by any change in our basic which remains peace and freedom for all the need for change is driven by the inexorable buildup of soviet military power and the increasing propensity of soviet leaders to use this power in coercion and outright aggression to impose their will on i have codified our evolving strategic doctrine in a number of interrelated and mutually supporting presidential their overarching theme is to provide a doctrinal and the specific program to implement that tells the world that no potential adversary of the united states could ever conclude that the fruits of his aggression would be significant or worth the enormous costs of our the presidential directives an overview of our strategic objectives basic space policy civil defense survivability and endurance for telecommunications mobilization planning continuity of government countervailing strategy for general these policies have been devised to first and soviet as such they confront not only soviet military forces but also soviet military by definition deterrence requires that we shape soviet assessments about the risks of assessments they will make using their not but at the same time we in no way seek to emulate their in nothing in our policy contemplates that nuclear warfare could ever be a deliberate instrument for achieving our own goals of peace and our policies are carefully devised to provide the greatest possible incentives and opportunities for future progress in arms our doctrinal evolution has been undertaken with appropriate consultation with our nato allies and we are fully consistent with strategy of flexible forces for nato we are greatly accelerating our ability to reinforce western europe with massive ground and air forces in a we are undertaking a major modernization program for the weapons and adding and tactical we are prepositioning more heavy equipment in europe to

to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their working with the we are appointing judges who will interpret the constitution as including a great new supreme court and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our we are defending our second and have taken historic actions to protect religious and we are serving our brave including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare last the congress and i the landmark va accountability since its my administration has already removed more than va employees who failed to give our veterans the care they

great all americans deserve accountability and respect and that is what we are giving so i call on the congress to empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the american in our drive to make washington we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in we have

believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their people who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure i want to give them a chance right here at it is time for the congress to give these wonderful americans the to one of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription in many other these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the united that is why i have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top prices will come america has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our our and our the era of economic surrender is from now we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be we will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new and we will protect american workers and american intellectual through strong enforcement of our trade as we rebuild our it is also time to rebuild our crumbling america is a nation of we built the empire state building in just year is it not a disgrace that it can now take years just to get a permit approved for a simple i am asking both parties to come together to give us the and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people i am calling on the congress to produce a bill that generates at least trillion for the new infrastructure investment we every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments where tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process getting it down to no more than two and perhaps even we can reclaim our building we will build gleaming new and waterways across our and we will do it with american american and american we want every american to know the dignity of a hard we want every child to be safe in their home at and we

job let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full and let us support working families by supporting paid family as america regains its this opportunity must be extended to all that is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second struggling especially immigrant will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of american workers and american for open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable they have allowed millions of workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest most they have caused the loss of many innocent here tonight are two fathers and two evelyn freddy elizabeth and robert their two teenage daughters kayla cuevas and nisa mickens were close friends on long but in september on the eve of neither of them came these two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their six members of the savage gang have been charged with kayla and many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors and wound up in kayla and high and everyone in this chamber is praying for everyone in america is grieving for and million hearts are breaking for we cannot imagine the depth of your but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this i am calling on the congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed and other to break into our we have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration and support our ice and border patrol so that this cannot ever happen the united states is a compassionate we are proud that we do more than any other country to help the the and the underprivileged all over the but as president of the united my highest my greatest and my constant concern is for struggling and forgotten i want our youth to grow up to achieve great i want our poor to have their chance to so i am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties democrats and republicans to protect our citizens of every and my and the sacred duty of every elected official in this is to defend americans to protect their their their and their right to the american because americans are dreamers here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our homeland security investigations special agent celestino martinez he goes by cj served years in the air force before becoming an ice agent and spending the last years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our at one leaders ordered but he did not cave to threats or last he commanded an operation to track down gang members on long his team has arrested nearly including more than from great now let us get the congress to send you some over the next few the house and senate will be voting on an immigration reform in recent my administration has met extensively with both democrats and republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration based on these we presented the congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise one where nobody gets everything they but where our country gets the critical reforms it here are the four pillars of our the first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age that covers almost three times more people than the previous under our those who meet education and work and show good moral will be able to become full citizens of the united the second pillar fully secures the that means building a wall on the southern and it means hiring more heroes like cj to keep our communities our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country and it finally ends the dangerous practice of and the third pillar ends the visa lottery a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for or the safety of our it is time to begin moving towards a immigration system one that admits people who are who want to who will contribute to our and who will love and respect our the fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain under the current broken a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant under our we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor this vital reform is not just for our but for our and our in recent two terrorist attacks in new york were made possible by the visa lottery and chain in the age of these programs present risks we can no longer it is time to reform these outdated immigration and finally bring our immigration system into the these four pillars represent a and one that will create a and lawful immigration for over washington has tried and failed to solve this this congress can be the one that finally makes it most these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts america so let us come set politics and finally get the job these reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug in we lost americans to drug deaths per seven per we must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this my administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in the struggle will be long and difficult as americans always we will as we have seen the most difficult challenges bring out the best in we see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the holets family of new ryan holets is years and an officer with the albuquerque police he is here tonight with his wife last ryan was on duty when he saw a homeless woman preparing to inject when ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn she began to she told him she did not know where to but badly wanted a safe home for her in that ryan said he felt god speak to will do it because you he took out a picture of his wife and their four he went home to tell his wife in an she agreed to the holets named their new daughter ryan and you embody the goodness of our thank and as we rebuild strength and confidence at we are also restoring our strength and standing around the we face rogue terrorist and rivals like china and russia that challenge our our and our in confronting these we know that weakness is the surest path to and unmatched power is the surest means of our for this i am asking the congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great as part of our we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear hopefully never having to use but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear we are not there last i also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish isis from the face of the one year i am proud to report that the coalition to defeat isis has liberated almost percent of the territory once held by these killers in iraq and but there is much more work to be we will continue our fight until isis is army staff sergeant justin peck is here near raqqa last justin and his chief petty officer kenton were on a mission to clear buildings that isis had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the clearing the second floor of a vital kenton stacy was severely wounded by an justin bounded into the building and found kenton in bad he applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an he then performed cpr for straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through hours of emergency kenton stacy would have died if not for selfless love for a fellow kenton is recovering in raqqa is and justin is wearing his new bronze with a for staff sergeant all of america salutes terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are when we annihilate when we must be able to detain and question but we must be terrorists are not merely they are unlawful enemy and when captured they should be treated like the terrorists they in the we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous only to meet them again on the battlefield including the isis so i am keeping another i just signed an order directing secretary mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at guantnamo i am also asking the congress to ensure in the fight against isis and we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists wherever we chase them our warriors in afghanistan also have new rules of along with their heroic afghan our military is no longer undermined by artificial and we no longer tell our enemies our last i also took an action endorsed unanimously by the senate just months i recognized jerusalem as the capital of shortly dozens of countries voted in the united nations general assembly against sovereign right to make this american taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every that is i am asking the congress to pass legislation to help ensure american dollars always serve american and only go to as we strengthen friendships around the we are also restoring clarity about our when the people of iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt i did not stay america stands with the people of iran in their courageous struggle for i am asking the congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible iran nuclear my administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in cuba and but no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in north north reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our we are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and i will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous we need only look at the depraved character of the north korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to america and our otto warmbier was a hardworking student at the university of on his way to study abroad in otto joined a tour to north at its this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the after a shameful the dictatorship sentenced otto to years of hard before returning him to america last june horribly injured and on the verge of he passed away just days after his fred and cindy are with us tonight along with brother and austin and you are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our and your strength inspires us we pledge to honor memory with american we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this his name is ji in was a starving boy in north one he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of in the he passed out on the train exhausted from he woke up as a train ran over his he then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the his brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves permanently stunting their own he was tortured by north korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to his tormentors wanted to know if he had met any he had and he resolved to be traveled thousands of miles on crutches across china and southeast asia to most of his family his father was caught trying to and was tortured to today he lives in where he rescues other and broadcasts into north korea what the regime fears the most the today he has a new but i understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in it was that same yearning for freedom that nearly years ago gave birth to a special place called it was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast but it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary that they could rule that they could chart their own and they could light up the that is what our country has always been that is what americans have always stood always strived and always atop the dome of this capitol stands the statue of she stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect monuments to washington and jefferson to lincoln and memorials to the heroes of yorktown and saratoga to young americans who shed their blood on the shores of and the fields and who went down in the waters of the pacific and the skies over and freedom stands tall over one more this this this living monument to the american a people whose heroes live not only in the but all around us defending and the american they work in every they sacrifice to raise a they care for our children at they defend our flag they are strong moms and brave they are police border and but above all they are and this this and this belong to our task is to respect to listen to to serve to protect and to always be worthy of americans fill the world with art and they push the bounds of science and and they forever remind us of what we should never the people dreamed this the people built this and it is the people who are making america great as long as we are proud of who we and what we are fighting there is nothing we cannot as long as we have confidence in our faith in our and trust in our we will not our families will our people will and our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and thank and god bless'"
